 * Event that is called when EntityRenderer executes current GuiScreen's drawScreen that does render
 * 
 * args: guiscreen (the GuiScreen that is about to be rendered), x (mouse's X coord), y (mouse's Y coord),
 * partialTicks (afaik, it's current ticks that are used for making animated stuff), screenType (the name of the class that event
 * is called from. Pretty much is used to identify super class GuiScreen call, because guiscreen arg will always return
 * subclass's name)
 * return: boolean (if false, Minecraft won't render this guiscreen)
